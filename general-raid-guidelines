Raid guidelines

Basic Rules
- Be on time
- Don't kiss the fire
- Use the discord
- Be kind
 
***__Attendance__***
Raiders are required ot be punctual. If you're going to be late or will be unable to attend, please let us know in ⁠raidchat💀🕷🕸﻿ channel as soon as you can.
﻿
||Invites start going out 10 minutes before the raid start time. Please show up at the half-hour pre=raid start time.
﻿
- This means showing up at 20:00 on Wednesday and Monday
- You are considered late after 15 minutes before pull time
    - If you're going to be late, please use  ⁠raidchat💀🕷🕸﻿ to let us know.
﻿
No "let me finish doing my world quest", no "I'm on an alt i'll log onto my main at 20:25", no delays. This time buffer allows for trash to be cleared and allows people to get gems, enchants etc from the bank in the process. If everyone logs in at 20:29 we cannot pull the boss at 20:30. Obviously if you can't be online early because of work etc, that's understandable - but if you're online, you're expected to be in the raid.||
﻿
Anyone who is late after raid begins should quietly join the voice channel and communicate via ⁠raidchat💀🕷🕸﻿  that they are available. We will let you know if a spot opens up for you after the current boss fight is over.
﻿
if you are leaving early, please whisper a raid lead at least one boss pull before you need to log off so we can find a replacement if necesarry.

Qualification
Please help us to make our guild’s raiding experience enjoyable for all and ensure you meet these requirements before attending any progression scheduled run.

We will be requiring some to come to Heroic raids before coming to Mythic. Even if you have killed the boss on Mythic before, you may not know how we do a boss, and we want to evaluate how you do the basics with us before moving onto more difficult bosses.
Optional events
The optional saturday raid is a "learner" raid. You are expected to show up willing to learn (or help others learning). We recommend a basic understanding of your class and general raid mechanics. It is up to you to provide food, enchants and gems. Most of this document is going to be relevant for the main raid events, not the optional raid events.
